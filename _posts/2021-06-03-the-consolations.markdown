excerpt: The Consolations of Philosophy sets out to refute the notion that good philosophy
  must be irrelevant and gathers together six great philosophers who were convinced
  of the power of philosophical insight to work a practical effect on our lives. Socrates,
  Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche are read for the light their
  work can shine on certain great universal problems, among them, unpopularity, poverty,
  inadequacy, lovelessness and timidity. The book amounts to a guide to wisdom – as
  well as to the practical utility of philosophy.

excerpt: We all know the headiness and excitement of love’s early days, but what can
  be expected over a shared lifetime? We follow our couple – Rabih and Kristen – from
  the first flush of infatuation through to inevitable disenchantments and then onto
  the freedom and insights of maturity. The Course of Love is a novel that explores
  not so much the start of love, as its maintenance over time; the way our ideals
  bend and reform under the pressures of an average existence, and the magnificent,
  sometimes frightening, developments we can make as we slowly realise that love is
  in essence a skill we need to learn rather than an enthusiasm we simply experience.

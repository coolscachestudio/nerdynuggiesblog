summary-title: thus spoke zarathustra
summary-author: Friedrich Nietzsche
summary: Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, written in the years 1883 to
  1885, is a pretty unusual book in the history of Western philosophy. It isn't really
  a novel, it isn't really poetry, and it's not really a traditional philosophical
  treatise. Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a philosophical parable that follows the wanderings
  of a character called Zarathustra, a Nietzschean prophet.

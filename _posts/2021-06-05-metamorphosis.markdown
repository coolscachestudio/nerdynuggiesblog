excerpt: The Metamorphosis is a novella written by Franz Kafka which was first published
  in 1915. One of Kafka's best-known works, The Metamorphosis tells the story of a
  young man who, who transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes
  an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially
  alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of
  inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of
  the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

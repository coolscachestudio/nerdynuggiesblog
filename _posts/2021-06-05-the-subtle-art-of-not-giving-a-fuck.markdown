excerpt: For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy,
  rich life. "F**k positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is fucked
  and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular internet blog, Manson doesn’t
  sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest
  truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is his antidote
  to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and
  spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.
